## Guidelines 

2. A PR should be focused and contained.If you are changing multiple unrelated things, they should be in separate PRs.
3. A PR should fix a bug or solve a problem - something that only you would use is not necessarily something that should be published.
4. Give your Pull Request a detailed title and description
 - look over your code one last time before actually creating the PR. Give it a self-review.

**Try to follow these guidelines if possible,It will make our work much easier and faster .**
